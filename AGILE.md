# BOOKWORMS et al

## Agile Methodology Overview

I have used GitHub Projects in the Agile development of my project. I created a new project in the Projects tab of my repository, named '@bookworms_et_al'. Within this Project I used a Kanban Board to track each User Story as I incrementally developed the MVP of the project.

## User Stories<a name="us"></a>

A user story is a small, self-contained unit of development. They are used to map the development progress of the project via a Kanban board. I have used these units in my Project to incrementally achieve the MVP.

Each user story is based on a bespoke user story Template which is created in the Settings tab of my GitHub repository.

| User Story Template                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| As a (role) I can (capability) so that (received benefit). |

Each User Story extends from the Template and is created in the Issues tab of my Github repository.

User Stories have been grouped and categorised into Epics using bespoke 'labels', where appropriate, and then assigned to the project named '@bookworms_et_al' where they are used to structure the development of the MVP of my project.

| User Story ID                   | As a (role)           | I want to be able to (capacity)                                    | so that I can (received benefit)                                                                                         |

## User Acceptance Criteria<a name="uac"></a>

I created a set of Acceptance Criteria for each User Story to set out a clear objective of what to achieve to complete each story. The objective is broken down into steps, and in that way is a clear and measurable way of confirming the work on that user story is complete and it can be moved to 'Done':

## MoSCoW Prioritisation<a name="moscow"></a>

### Prioritisation of User Stories

I have used MoSCoW Prioritisation to assign a priority level to the User Stories of the Project. 'MoSCoW' is an acronym for 'Must have', 'Should have', 'Could have, 'Will not have' and represent the prioritisation level applied to User Stories during this iteration of production. For the purpose of this project, 'an iteration' represents this project's lifecycle up to submission.

- Must Have - these User Stories are non-negotiable and represent the core functionality of the Project. As such, they are guaranteed to be delivered. 'Must have' features of this project are the Responsive front-end design, User Registration and Authentication, and CRUD. This represents approximately 60% of the effort planned for the project overall.

- Should Have and Could Have - Should have/Could have can be grouped together as being important aspects of the Project adding significant value, but as they are not vital they should each represent approximately 20% of the effort planned for the project.

- Won't Have - User Stories marked as Won't have may be included as features in future iterations of my Project, but will not be delivered in this iteration.

## User Story Tasks<a name="ust"></a>

I have used the acceptance criteria steps to create user story tasks to facilitate the execution of each User Story. Once these tasks for each User Story are complete and tested, the User Story is finished and is assigned as 'Done' in the Project Kanban.
